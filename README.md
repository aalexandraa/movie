# Movie Search App

The app uses the the Movie DB API to find you movie info.

## Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://aalexandraa.github.io/movie/

### Did you watch all of Netflix during the corona lockdown?

Just use the Movie Search App to get some great inspiration on what movies to watch.

Enter any keyword, e.g. 'flower' and find a list of movies with title, the DVD Cover, release date,rating and short description.

Hopefully this will help you find new ideas for your next movie evening.

### In the background

When you click the Search button it fetches the movies, that contains your input, from the Movie DB api and displays it with the poster, title and release date. If the api can't fetch anything with the input, it displays an error.
Only items with posters will be displayed.
